One telegram bot to learn them all.

This bot can track web feeds. She tries to sort their content in order and send updates about once an hour. But, Replitâ€™s web hosting sometimes goes offline. <br>
I had a lot of fun working on this project. Although it was written without knowledge of architectural patterns and suffers from design problems; maybe one day I'll fix it. <br>
The bot chassis uses pyTelegramBotAPI. The webhook made on Flask accepts commands from Telegram, and the database works through SQLAlchemy. <br>
For the first time I studied testing through the unittest framework.

If you want to run a copy, you need to get a bot API from BotFather and install cURL. <br>
Work on Windows do not guaranteed.
